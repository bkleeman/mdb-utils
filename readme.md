# mdb-utils

A set of boilerplate MongoDB utility scripts based off of those fround on the w3schools [Node.js/MongoDB tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mongodb.asp), but improved to move past some bugs that were present in the tutorial during September 2019. Each script is additionally outfitted with a variable space for your password and connection string, so you can save the structure of your file, keep it in a public repo, or intentionally share it with others. Set up to run with an MLab cluster. 

## Getting Started

0. Set up a cluster at [MLAB](https://mlab.com/) for your MonogoDB database 
1. `git clone https://github.com/bkleeman/mdb-utils.git`
2. `npm install`
3. Choose a file that corresponds with the operation you want to learn/use and add your password.
4. `node <filename>.js`
5. Check your MLAB cluster and its relevant collection(s) to see the fruits of your labor!
