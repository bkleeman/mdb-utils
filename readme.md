# mdb-utils

A set of boilerplate MongoDB utility scripts based off of those fround on the w3schools [Node.js/MongoDB tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mongodb.asp), but improved to move past some bugs that were present in the tutorial during September 2019. Each script is additionally outfitted with a variable space for your password and connection string, so you can save the structure of your file, keep it in a public repo, or intentionally share it with others. Set up to run with an MLab cluster.
